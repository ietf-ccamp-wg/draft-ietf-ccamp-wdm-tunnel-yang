          "body": "I mostly fixed all the errors of the module and now it is almost aligned with current version of layer0-types, layer0-types-ext and ietf-te-topology. Here is a summary:\r\n\r\n-  Whenever a grouping of layer0-types was not found, we look for it in the current version. Most of them were just renamed so it was only a matter of finding the right one.\r\n- Some of the old groupings are no longer in the layer0-types. FEC was in layer0-types-ext but term-type, wavelength assignment and flexi-grid-path-bandwidth were eliminated without clear equivalents. \r\n- Some TE-topology paths were also wrong. In most cases, it was easy to update them but, in some cases, I didn't find an equivalent node in the current TE-topo doc. In these cases, I comment out those sections.\r\n- In layer-0-types, there is an error causing validation problems. In line 523, I think `must '. >= min-slot-width-factor'` should be `must '. >= ../min-slot-width-factor'`. If someone checks that I am right, we can report this to the authors.\r\n\r\n Any help or comment is welcome with the last three points! :)",

      "body": "I mostly fixed all the errors of the module and now it is almost aligned with current version of layer0-types, layer0-types-ext and ietf-te-topology. Here is a summary:\r\n\r\n-  Whenever a grouping of layer0-types was not found, we look for it in the current version. Most of them were just renamed so it was only a matter of finding the right one.\r\n- Some of the old groupings are no longer in the layer0-types. FEC was in layer0-types-ext but term-type, wavelength assignment and flexi-grid-path-bandwidth were eliminated without clear equivalents. \r\n- Some TE-topology paths were also wrong. In most cases, it was easy to update them but, in some cases, I didn't find an equivalent node in the current TE-topo doc. In these cases, I comment out those sections.\r\n- In layer-0-types, there is an error causing validation problems. In line 523, I think `must '. >= min-slot-width-factor'` should be `must '. >= ../min-slot-width-factor'`. If someone checks that I am right, we can report this to the authors.\r\n\r\n Any help or comment is welcome with the last three points! :)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dperdices in https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-media-channel-yang/issues/1#issuecomment-772474262_",

Although most of the transceivers can fit in 100 GHz spacing (e.g. 62.5 GHz) the ROADM technology evolved to flexi-grid solution to optimise the bandwidth usage. The transceivers imposing such requirements benefit of the new generation coherent technology, so any legacy transceiver like 10Gb/s, 40Gb/s are not applicable to this draft.\"\r\n\r\nWill integrate into latest version. \r\n",

Therefore the controller is able to support both services with coherent (100G & above) and DD (10G,40G) transponders.\r\nThere are also cases when the controller needs to manage networks built separately with coherent and non-coherent transponders.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions is that for optical impairment and RFC9093-bis the DCU availability will not be supported and exposed, therefore it will not support external path computation by the hierarchical controller (MDSC) for legacy 10G/40G WDM networks. Proprietary extensions are needed for external path computation.\r\n\r\nFor the WDM tunnel model it should support both the legacy 10G/40G and coherent services because the path computation and optical feasibility check are fully delegated to the optical PNC.",

The best way to move forward is to add a mapping of lsp-id to e2e-mc-path-id on the LSP reporting in the WDM tunnel model.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the mapping should be contained within each link hop of an lsp.

All that would simplify the reading of the model making more easy to understand also what could be missed in the model. Other example is the \u201clist of links (and I would say nodes)  that defines the path, not clear where is in the model at a first glance, a pointer to model entity would be great.\r\n\r\n- Section 4: \u201cNote that every element in the flexi-grid topology has a reference, and this is the way in which they are called in the tunnel.\u201d . This sentence is not clear to me, do you mean an identifier, leafref ?\r\nAn example would be good here.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what nodes are connected.\u201d \r\nAlso here we should add the pointer to the model to clarify where in the model that will happen.\r\n\r\nIn general, since the long list of augmentation to te-model is not easy to follow, having a short description of the major constructs of the model would make any review of the model faster and more sure. \r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nregarding the discussion on snr discussion. It is not clear to me what is meant by snr here and what will it be used for:\r\n\r\ncase 1: this is a value computed at commissioning thanks to BER or Q factor, then the method should be reported. Besides, an old value it is not anymore a valid value because of system loading or ageing. So I can not really exploit it. I would rather look at the current BER or Q factor and refer to the B2B curve.\r\n\r\ncase 2: this is a value reported by transceiver: I have no clue of what is exactly reported, because there is no common (standard?) method used by transceivers to expose SNR, so that I don't know what I am looking at. so I can not exploit it. \r\n\r\ncase 3: I could  monitor the value on the long term to monitor service degradation, but I can not assume that the value reported in tunnel is fresh: it may be from last week, last month... so not really useful to monitor quality.\r\n\r\ncase 4: this is a value computed at planning phase including expected degration till end of life (eg full load, ...). Then I can not exploit it, because I don't know what are the assumption and methods used for computing it. So I can not compare with computations I would do today.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all case, I can not exploit what is reported, because I don't know:\r\n\r\n- how this was measured/computed\r\n- when it was measured/computed\r\n\r\nMy take is that:\r\n\r\n- BER and Q factor would be enough for my usage of the tunnels (precising in the model definition that this is last extracted values for example), to have a snapshot of my tunnel health and compute possible remaining margin (provided I have BtB curves). \r\n- If some snr value is reported by transceivers, this should be added in interface so that I can use PM telemetry to monitor its evolution (relative values being already a good insight of health, even if I don't really know what it is). a reference to the method used to compute it would be appreciated.\r\n- if some snr value is reported in the tunnel, then this should include the measurement/computation method and time of measurement (last extraction or initial values or planning for example).\r\n\r\nLastly, the only standard I know about GSNR measurement is [T-REC-G.977.1-202010-I!!PDF-E.pdf] and it says \"Standardized techniques for the measurement of SNRi, are still under study\". The example in the doc relies on btb curves.\r\nSo we should be careful when using the term SNR or GSNR.\r\n\r\nregards",

I understand the purpose of this choice is to facilitate the configuration for single-carrier scenario and also maybe multi-carrier scenario when all carriers have the same configurations? We could simplify the modeling by just configuring the number of carriers without using the choice statement. That also means all carriers will carry the same configuration which is true in practice.

One is sufficient (I prefer pre-fec-ber :)).\r\nif the two are reported for the same time stamp they should be consistent. if they are not, this can be a symptom of something hapenning on the physical layer that needs further investigation. So my preference would be to keep both, and not force any consistency by the model (the values are transferred as is from the SBI interface, and the usage of the data is left for the applications that consume this model), as we would maybe miss some issues.
