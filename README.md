# A YANG Data Model for Flexi-Grid Tunnels

## Scope

This repository is to facilitate the work on the [IETF CCAMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ccamp/documents/) WG Internet-Draft,
"A YANG Data Model for Flexi-Grid Optical Networks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-media-channel-yang/)".

## Abstract

   This document defines a YANG model for managing flexi-grid optical
   tunnels (media-channels), complementing the information provided by
   the flexi-grid topology model.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).
