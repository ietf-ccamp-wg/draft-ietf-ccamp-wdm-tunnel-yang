1.  Introduction

   Transport networks have evolved from traditional fixed-grid
   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) [RFC6163] to more
   scalable and flexible elastic optical networks.  These utilize flexi-
   grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technologies
   [RFC7698] to optimize bandwidth usage.  Current DWDM Optical Network
   deployments may include fixed-grid WSON, flexi-grid DWDM, or a
   combination of both.

   In the optical domain, a WDM tunnel typically originates and
   concludes at a pair of transponders using one or more transceivers
   dependent upon the data rate and encoding type of the transceivers.
   These transponders are then connected to an intermediate line system
   composed of optical switches and multiplexers, including
   Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADMs) and add-drop
   multiplexers, complemented by optical amplifiers to boost the
   transmission distance.  The optical wavelength can be routed from the
   transponder or an incoming fiber, through multiplexing, to various
   outgoing fibers in the DWDM network.  At optical nodes, wavelengths

   may undergo conversion via optical-electrical-optical (OEO)
   regenerators, depending on the switching setup and fiber
   configuration.

   Optical services, transmitted via analog signals, require careful
   provisioning across the network to maintain signal quality and
   prevent interference between different wavelength channels.  The
   technology within optical nodes, like tunable transceivers or
   Colorless, Directionless and Contentionless Flexi-grid (CDC-F)
   ROADMs, introduces specific constraints that can limit WDM tunnel
   path options.  These constraints must be factored into WDM tunnel
   provisioning and pre-computation.  Additionally, assessing the end-
   to-end optical performance metrics like Generalized Signal-to-noise
   Ratio (G-SNR), Bit Error Rate (BER), and Q-factor is crucial to
   ensure transmission quality and receiver signal integrity.

   This draft introduces a YANG [RFC7950] data model for setting up and
   managing TE tunnels and LSPs in DWDM Optical Networks.  It aims to
   provide an intent-based interface used by a control entity such as a
   Software-defined Network (SDN) controller at its northbound to
   establish services between endpoints, typically optical transponders.
   Clients can utilize this model to either partially or fully delegate
   service provisioning to the SDN controller, while still capable to
   express additional constraints to guide its operation.  Service
   provisioning can be as simple as identifying the source and
   destination transponders and delegate the rest of determination to
   the SDN controller, or as explicit as specifying a complete detailed
   path complete with tuned wavelengths and transceiver details.

   This document identifies the WDM tunnel components, parameters and
   their values, and characterizes the features and the performances of
   the WDM elements.  An application example is provided towards the end
   of the document to understand their utility better.

3.  Overview

   The YANG data model in this draft builds upon the generic TE tunnel
   model from [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  This base model is suitable for
   all TE-enabled networks and includes universal TE tunnel elements
   like node addresses, tunnel termination points (TTPs), and path-level
   constraints such as explicit path hops, label restrictions, and path
   diversity.  The current model enhances [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] by
   incorporating WDM-specific attributes and constraints relevant to WDM
   tunnels, including definitions for:

   *  Network-scope optical transceiver configuration constraints, e.g.,
      operational modes, transceiver tuning constraints

   *  Network-scope WDM path routing policies for influencing WDM TE
      path selection.  For exmaple, whether or not using regenerator or
      wavelength conversion is allowed, whether or not wavelength
      retuing is allowed for tunable transceivers, etc.

   *  Network-scope optical performance constraints, e.g. the
      generalized Signal-to-noise (G-SNR) margin and delta power of a
      feasible optical path

   *  Path-scope WDM layer constraints and transceiver configurations
      for working and protection path within a WDM tunnel

   *  List of WDM nodes, links, and optical wavelength that constitute
      an end-to-end WDM path

   *  Other relevant optical attributes which characterize the optical
      signal

   The attributes described above are optional, allowing the model to
   support both simplified and fully-explicit WDM tunnel provisioning to
   meet diverse client requirements.

   Additionally, the YANG model provides the status of a WDM tunnel,
   which includes:

   *  Computed paths for various roles such as working, protection, and
      restoration, indicating potential optical paths confirmed by the
      SDN controller via pre-computation.

   *  Actual LSPs for each tunnel path, representing the optical paths
      currently established in the network.

3.1.  Integrated vs. External Optical Transponder

   In optical networks built with traditional chassis-based DWDM optical
   equipment, optical transponder (OTs) are typically inserted into the
   chassis installed as cards.  WDM tunnels are established between
   pairs of OTs, with the SDN controller serving as the central entity
   for provisioning and managing these tunnels.

   In scenarios like data center interconnects (DCI), optical
   transponders may be externally mounted on a 'pizza box' and linked
   via dedicated fiber or wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer to the
   optical line system.  These external OTs could be managed by the same
   SDN controller or a different entity, such as an orchestrator.
   Consequently, a WDM tunnel might be composed of several segments
   joined to create a continuous end-to-end tunnel.

   The YANG data model offers a cohesive interface for managing WDM
   tunnels and tunnel segments, irrespective of transponder location.

4.  Example of Use

   To illustrate the model's application, consider an optical network
   with various transponders, switches, and links.  A depicted topology
   outlines two WDM tunnel scenarios.  In the first, an end-to-end WDM
   tunnel (WDM Tunnel 1) comprises two physical paths (WDM Primary Path
   1 and 2) linking two integrated optical transponders, Transponder A
   and E, through WSON and Flexi-grid nodes.  The second scenario
   describes three WDM tunnel segments (WDM Tunnel Segment 2a to 2c)
   connecting two external OTs, External OT node X and Y, via the same
   nodes and links.

                         Figure 1: Topology Example

   To configure an end-to-end WDM tunnel to interconnect transponders A
   and E, first of all we have to populate the flexi-grid topology YANG
   model with all elements in the network:

   *  We define the transponders within nodes A and E as tunnel
      termination points (TTPs) and provide their internal local link
      connectivity towards the node interfaces.  We also provide nodes A
      and E identifiers, addresses and interfaces.

Internet-Draft            WDM Tunnel YANG Model                July 2025


   *  We do the same for the nodes B, C and D, providing their
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces, as well as the internal
      connectivity matrix between interfaces.

   *  Then, we also define the links 1 to 5 that interconnect nodes,
      indicating which WSON or flexi-grid labels are available.

   *  Other information, such as the slot frequency and granularity are
      also provided.

   After the nodes, links and transponders have been defined using
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang] and [RFC9094] we can configure the
   tunnel from the information we have stored in the flexi-grid
   topology, by querying which elements are available, and planning the
   resources that have to be provided on each situation, taking into
   account the global and path-specific WDM tunnel constraints.  Note
   that every element in the flexi-grid topology has a reference, and
   this is the way in which they are called in the tunnel.

   *  Depending on the case, it is possible to define either the source
      and destination node ports, or the source and destination node and
      transponder.  In our case, we would define a network tunnel, with
      source transponder A and source node B, and destination
      transponder E and destination node C.  Thus, we are going to
      follow path x.

   *  Then, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we
      are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what
      nodes are connected.

   *  Finally, the flexi-grid topology has to be updated with each
      element usage status each time a tunnel is created or torn down.

          These constraints further limit the resources available
          to the tunnel. All constraints operate inclusively, using
          an AND logic. For example, if a specific frequency range
          is selected, the tunnel must also be constrained to match
          only that range.

          When these constraints are combined with the operational
          mode, the list of operational modes should exclude any
          modes that cannot satisfy the additional constraints.
          For instance, if the frequency is restricted to the C-band,

6.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URIs in the
   "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  Following
   the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are requested.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-wdm-tunnel
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG modules in
   the "IANA Module Names" [RFC6020].  Following the format in
   [RFC6020], the following registrations are requested:

      name: ietf-wdm-tunnel
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-wdm-tunnel
      prefix: wdm-tnl
      reference: RFC XXXX

   RFC Editor: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to this
   document.
