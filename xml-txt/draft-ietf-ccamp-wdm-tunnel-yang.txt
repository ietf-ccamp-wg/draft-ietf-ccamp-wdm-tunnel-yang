1.  Introduction

   Transport networks have evolved from traditional Wavelength Switched
   Optical Networks (WSON) systems [RFC6163] based on only fixed-grid
   wavelength switching, towards elastic optical networks, based on
   flexi-grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transmission
   and switching technologies [RFC7698].  Such technology aims at
   increasing transport network scalability and flexibility, allowing
   bandwidth usage optimization.

   While [RFC9094] [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang] focus on flexi-grid
   objects such as nodes, transponders and links, this document presents
   a YANG [RFC7950] model for the provisioning and management of Traffic
   Engineering (TE) tunnels and Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in DWDM
   Optical Networks, which can be Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
   (WSON) networks or Flexi-Grid Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
   (DWDM) Networks, or a mix of these two networks.  This YANG module
   defines the path from a source transponder or node to the destination
   through several intermediate nodes in such a WDM optical network.

Internet-Draft            WDM Tunnel YANG Model               March 2024


   This document identifies the WDM tunnel components, parameters and
   their values, and characterizes the features and the performances of
   the WDM elements.  An application example is provided towards the end
   of the document to understand their utility better.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

   Refer to [RFC7446] and [RFC7699] for the key terms used in this
   document.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here: - client

   *  server

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here: - configuration data

   *  state data

3.  Overview

   The generic TE tunnel attributes, such as source and destination node
   addresses, source and destination tunnel termination points (TTPs),
   are already defined by the base data model in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  The present model defines a WDM tunnel by
   augmenting the base model with the following WDM technology-specific
   constructs:

   *  Global WDM layer constraints that influence the TE path selection,
      e.g., whether wavelength conversion or regeneration is considered

Internet-Draft            WDM Tunnel YANG Model               March 2024


   *  Global transponder/transceiver configuration constraints, e.g.,
      operational modes, tuning constraints of the transceiver

   *  Global optical performance constraints, e.g. generalized Signal-
      to-noise (G-SNR) margin of a feasible optical path

   *  Path-scope WDM layer constraints, e.g. identities of transceivers
      assigned to the primary or secondary path

   *  List of links that defines the path

   *  Other optical attributes

   Each path can be a segment path (only defined by the source and
   destination nodes or link termination points) or an end-to-end path
   (additionally needs source and destination transponders).  Therefore,
   all the attributes are optional to support both situations.

4.  Example of Use

   In order to explain how this model is used, the following example is
   provided.  An optical network usually has multiple transponders,
   switches (nodes) and links.  Figure 1 shows a simple topology, where
   two physical paths interconnect two optical transponders via a
   combination of both WSON and Flexi-grid wavelength switched nodes and
   links.

                         Figure 1: Topology Example

   To configure an end-to-end WDM tunnel to interconnect transponders A
   and E, first of all we have to populate the flexi-grid topology YANG
   model with all elements in the network:

   *  We define the transponders within nodes A and E as tunnel
      termination points (TTPs) and provide their internal local link
      connectivity towards the node interfaces.  We also provide nodes A
      and E identifiers, addresses and interfaces.

   *  We do the same for the nodes B, C and D, providing their
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces, as well as the internal
      connectivity matrix between interfaces.

   *  Then, we also define the links 1 to 5 that interconnect nodes,
      indicating which WSON or flexi-grid labels are available.

   *  Other information, such as the slot frequency and granularity are
      also provided.

Internet-Draft            WDM Tunnel YANG Model               March 2024


   After the nodes, links and transponders have been defined using
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang] and [RFC9094] we can configure the
   tunnel from the information we have stored in the flexi-grid
   topology, by querying which elements are available, and planning the
   resources that have to be provided on each situation, taking into
   account the global and path-specific WDM tunnel constraints.  Note
   that every element in the flexi-grid topology has a reference, and
   this is the way in which they are called in the tunnel.

   *  Depending on the case, it is possible to define either the source
      and destination node ports, or the source and destination node and
      transponder.  In our case, we would define a network tunnel, with
      source transponder A and source node B, and destination
      transponder E and destination node C.  Thus, we are going to
      follow path x.

   *  Then, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we
      are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what
      nodes are connected.

   *  Finally, the flexi-grid topology has to be updated with each
      element usage status each time a tunnel is created or torn down.

          These constraints further limit the resources available

          an AND logic. For example, if a specific frequency range
          is selected, the tunnel must also be constrained to match
          only that range.

          When these constraints are combined with the operational
          mode, the list of operational modes should exclude any
          modes that cannot satisfy the additional constraints.
          For instance, if the frequency is restricted to the C-band,

6.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel

   *  /te:te/.../te:te-bandwidth/te:technology

   *  /te:te/.../te:type/te:label/te:label-hop/te:te-label/te:technology

   *  /te:te/.../te:label-restrictions/te:label-restriction/te:label-
      start/te:te-label/te:technology

   *  /te:te/.../te:label-restrictions/te:label-restriction/te:label-
      end/te:te-label/te:technology

   *  /te:te/.../te:label-restrictions/te:label-restriction/

   Editors note: we are using simplified description by folding similar
   branches to avoid repetition.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URIs in the
   "ns" subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  Following
   the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are requested.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-wdm-tunnel
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.
